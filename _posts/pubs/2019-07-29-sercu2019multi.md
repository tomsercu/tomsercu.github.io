    We introduce Multi-Frame Cross-Entropy training (MFCE) for convolutional
    neural network acoustic models. Recognizing that similar to RNNs, CNNs are in
    nature sequence models that take variable length inputs, we propose to take as
    input to the CNN a part of an utterance long enough that multiple labels are
    predicted at once, therefore getting cross-entropy loss signal from multiple
    adjacent frames. This increases the amount of label information drastically for
    small marginal computational cost. We show large WER improvements on hub5 and
    rt02 after training on the 2000-hour Switchboard benchmark.

    In this paper, we propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    architecture for learning multi-scale feature representations with good
    tradeoffs between speed and accuracy. This is achieved by using a multi-branch
    network, which has different computational complexity at different branches.
    Through frequent merging of features from branches at distinct scales, our
    model obtains multi-scale features while using less computation. The proposed
    approach demonstrates improvement of model efficiency and performance on both
    object recognition and speech recognition tasks,using popular architectures
    including ResNet and ResNeXt. For object recognition, our approach reduces
    computation by 33% on object recognition while improving accuracy with 0.9%.
    Furthermore, our model surpasses state-of-the-art CNN acceleration approaches
    by a large margin in accuracy and FLOPs reduction. On the task of speech
    recognition, our proposed multi-scale CNNs save 30% FLOPs with slightly better
    word error rates, showing good generalization across domains.

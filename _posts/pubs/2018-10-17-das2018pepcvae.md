abstract: >
    Given the emerging global threat of antimicrobial resistance, new methods for
    next-generation antimicrobial design are urgently needed. We report a peptide
    generation framework PepCVAE, based on a semi-supervised variational
    autoencoder (VAE) model, for designing novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP)
    sequences. Our model learns a rich latent space of the biological peptide
    context by taking advantage of abundant, unlabeled peptide sequences. The model
    further learns a disentangled antimicrobial attribute space by using the
    feedback from a jointly trained AMP classifier that uses limited labeled
    instances. The disentangled representation allows for controllable generation
    of AMPs. Extensive analysis of the PepCVAE-generated sequences reveals superior
    performance of our model in comparison to a plain VAE, as PepCVAE generates
    novel AMP sequences with higher long-range diversity, while being closer to the
    training distribution of biological peptides. These features are highly desired
    in next-generation antimicrobial design.

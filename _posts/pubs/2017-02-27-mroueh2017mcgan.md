excerpt: ""
abstract: "We introduce new families of Integral Probability Metrics (IPM) for training
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Our IPMs are based on matching
statistics of distributions embedded in a finite dimensional feature space.
Mean and covariance feature matching IPMs allow for stable training of GANs,
which we will call McGan. McGan minimizes a meaningful loss between
distributions."

    In computer vision pixelwise dense prediction is the task of predicting a
    label for each pixel in the image. Convolutional neural networks achieve good
    performance on this task, while being computationally efficient. In this paper
    we carry these ideas over to the problem of assigning a sequence of labels to a
    set of speech frames, a task commonly known as framewise classification. We
    show that dense prediction view of framewise classification offers several
    advantages and insights, including computational efficiency and the ability to
    apply batch normalization. When doing dense prediction we pay specific
    attention to strided pooling in time and introduce an asymmetric dilated
    convolution, called time-dilated convolution, that allows for efficient and
    elegant implementation of pooling in time. We show results using time-dilated
    convolutions in a very deep VGG-style CNN with batch normalization on the Hub5
    Switchboard-2000 benchmark task. With a big n-gram language model, we achieve
    7.7% WER which is the best single model single-pass performance reported so
    far.

    We present an empirical investigation of a recent class of Generative
    Adversarial Networks (GANs) using Integral Probability Metrics (IPM) and their
    performance for semi-supervised learning. IPM-based GANs like Wasserstein GAN,
    Fisher GAN and Sobolev GAN have desirable properties in terms of theoretical
    understanding, training stability, and a meaningful loss. In this work we
    investigate how the design of the critic (or discriminator) influences the
    performance in semi-supervised learning. We distill three key take-aways which
    are important for good SSL performance: (1) the K+1 formulation, (2) avoiding
    batch normalization in the critic and (3) avoiding gradient penalty constraints
    on the classification layer.

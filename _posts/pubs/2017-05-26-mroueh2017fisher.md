    Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are powerful models for learning
    complex distributions. Stable training of GANs has been addressed in many
    recent works which explore different metrics between distributions. In this
    paper we introduce Fisher GAN which fits within the Integral Probability
    Metrics (IPM) framework for training GANs. Fisher GAN defines a critic with a
    data dependent constraint on its second order moments. We show in this paper
    that Fisher GAN allows for stable and time efficient training that does not
    compromise the capacity of the critic, and does not need data independent
    constraints such as weight clipping. We analyze our Fisher IPM theoretically
    and provide an algorithm based on Augmented Lagrangian for Fisher GAN. We
    validate our claims on both image sample generation and semi-supervised
    classification using Fisher GAN.

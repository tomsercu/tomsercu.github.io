excerpt: ""
abstract: >
    De novo therapeutic design is challenged by a vast chemical repertoire and
    multiple constraints, e.g., high broad-spectrum potency and low toxicity. We
    propose CLaSS (Controlled Latent attribute Space Sampling) - an efficient
    computational method for attribute-controlled generation of molecules, which
    leverages guidance from classifiers trained on an informative latent space of
    molecules modeled using a deep generative autoencoder. We screen the generated
    molecules for additional key attributes by using deep learning classifiers in
    conjunction with novel features derived from atomistic simulations. The
    proposed approach is demonstrated for designing non-toxic antimicrobial
    peptides (AMPs) with strong broad-spectrum potency, which are emerging drug
    candidates for tackling antibiotic resistance. Synthesis and testing of only
    twenty designed sequences identified two novel and minimalist AMPs with high
    potency against diverse Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including
    one multidrug-resistant and one antibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae, via
    membrane pore formation. Both antimicrobials exhibit low in vitro and in vivo
    toxicity and mitigate the onset of drug resistance. The proposed approach thus
    presents a viable path for faster and efficient discovery of potent and
    selective broad-spectrum antimicrobials.

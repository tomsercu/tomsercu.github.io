title: "Generative Adversarial Networks â€“ hands-on tutorial in pytorch"
venue: "NYC AI & ML meetup"
slides: "https://github.com/tomsercu/gan-tutorial-pytorch"
excerpt: "[Github Repository with notebook](https://github.com/tomsercu/gan-tutorial-pytorch)
This talk is a hands-on live coding tutorial. We will implement a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to learn to generate small images. We will assume only a superficial familiarity with deep learning and a notion of PyTorch. This tutorial is as self-contained as possible. The goal is that this talk/tutorial can serve as an introduction to PyTorch at the same time as being an introduction to GANs.

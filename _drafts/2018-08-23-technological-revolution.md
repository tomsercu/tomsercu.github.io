title:  "AI Revolution or technological revolution?"

Many opinion makers pitch AI as "the next big disruptive technology".
I want to take a step back and look from a historical lens what have been the big
economical & social revolutions in the past, and how technology and AI fits in.

# Pre-industrial revolution
TODO research those numbers!
* Agrarian 90%
* Industrial: shift to blue collar, automate farming
* Late industrial: automate many blue collar jobs
    through improved machines and very dumb robotics.
    Shift to services / white collar
* Technological revolution:
    - farming: improve. micro farming. CHALLENGING
    - industry: smarter robots, smarter factories?
    - transport: big emploeyr. last big disruption CONTAINER
        road transport not so different
        self-driving: trucking seems best pick
    - finance:
        improve stock markets efficiency
        screw over stock markets through HFT
    - white-collar:
        printing, typewriters etc.
        computer for administration
        computer + internet: disruptive everywehre
            automate white collar
        smartphone + internet: shift 
        AI: impacts (1) computer+inet (2) smartphone+inet
            1) lawyers, doctors
                routine non routine   vs  hi skill lo skill.
                FREES US UP FROM BUSY WORK
            2) consumer, rerouting human behavior. Targeted local & real-time markets.
                ENABLES NEW INTERESTING WORK
                New blog post real-time local preferential markets. Reread MJordan thing. Write blog post
anyway this needs more thought and research.
* historical numbers
* main industries and main disruptions in those industries.


Ok back to continuity argument:
Basically there's no big new shift by AI.
- Continuous evolution: machines early industry -> machines late industry -> machines current industry
- dumb robotics -> slightly smarter robotics
- white collar: no computer -> computer (+30%) -> computer+inet (+70%) -> computer+inet+AI (+30%?)
- industrial: workshop -> conveyer belt (+40%) -> conveyer + robotics (+50%) -> conv+robotics+a bit automation? (+10%)

Break down per industry and value added by AI in the next 10 years.
- farming: neh
- industrial blue collar: slow, (+20%)
- transport: well ok here we have a big one
- finance: quants based on stochastic PDE to more NN based trading. Probably limited tho.
    Some additional tools from NLP and fast reactions to news to buy/sell.
    Maybe can cause super instable markets & collapse at some point.
    But not much real value for long-term investments = real finance.
- white-collar: added value from AI small wrt technological improvement
- medical: slow adoption. currently still using faxes.
- and services: human contact won't be replaced. tech not there yet.

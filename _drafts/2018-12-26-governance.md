It's popular to see google/fb/amazon as the bad guys.
The main reason I think is the feeling of consumers to be powerless and have no control over the direction of those tech giants.
There's no accountability.
They're providing enormous value to society but are out of touch with the "customers" they're serving.

Monopoly problem: there's no alternative, so market can't regulate this

There's no clear value alignment - the big tech companies are off to make money, and maybe if they feel like it they
can also be good for their customers.

Leading / running bigtech is like running a government.
Now they're autocracies, run by CEO's and maybe a more or less powerful board.

How can we make them more like democracies, where their constituency have a voice?
How can we force value alignment between the tech companies and the audience of their products (let's call them customers),
in a profit-driven framework?

# Through actual government
Should be setting out a framework for these companies to be held accountable.
problem:
+ lack of expertise in govt
+ very indirect government: consituency elects representatives, which supposedly then regulates big tech.

How to mitigate:
+ provide clear rewards/incentives for expert industry leaders/academics to consult for the government
+ below

# More direct government
+ Independent external consultants with deep expertise provide list of improvements and an estimated
   expense to implement
+ Constituents get to vote on a list of priorities and KPI (privacy, ..).
+ Companies are demanded (by actual government) to implement top X of those changes, based on budget and bigness
    with clear monetary penalties if not meeting those.

I want to talk about something different than the usual topics on my blog - wait,
who am I kidding? There's only one post from a year ago.

Anyway, this post is ***talking about why it's so hard to start something new,
and what I do to overcome the intimidation***.
I write this mostly from my perspective as a computer science researcher,
and this comes 100 percent from my experience. No guarantees this applies to you.
But I'd like to hear your opinion or if you can relate.

<!--Start with something positive, then something bad, then something positive to finish.-->
Some good news to start.
In my experience, acquiring a new skill or learning a new research domain,
it kind of goes like this:

(Figure 1)

t0 is when you actually start going at it:
coding something up (or copying someone elses code), running the code, modifying, iterate.
My hypothesis is that in these first 2 days or week, you learn very fast.
Talking about a research domain or technique that's closely related to your expertise,
a couple of days to 2 weeks of focused work usually gets you a really firm understanding
of the basics and gets you confidence you can tackle problems in that domain.

Now here's the bad news.
The first little part of that line doesn't look that good.
I'd call this the barrier to getting started.
And this is the part that's intimidating.
Let's zoom in.

(Figure 2)

Before starting, the barrier looks way more intimidating than it actually is.
<!-- long before you start learning, and slow slope -->

So here's the question: how do we make sure we get in region 2 as fast as possible?

Here are some ideas.
 * Don't think about how to properly structure this project.
   Just make a folder in your home directory and dump stuff in there.
   Don't clean anything up for the first 2 days.
   After you got some experience, move everything to a subfolder titled 01_initial_junk.
   Then copy everything over and try to organize yourself a little better.
   Possibly iterate this with subfolders 02_still_junk and 03_third_try_still_sucks.
 * Set a strict short deadline one or two days into the future. 
   If you're on yourself, plan one day for full focus on this new project,
   and push yourself to get as far as posible in this one day.
   If you have colleagues or collaborators, make it a real deadline by setting a meeting
   to discuss whatever you learned or promise to deliver something.
   This deadline is a perfect way to push yourself in regime 2.

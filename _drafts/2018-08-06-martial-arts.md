I started training Judo / Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu about a year ago,
and realized the different branches of sport Martial Arts (combat sports) 
represent a variation of the Bias-Variance trade-off, which I will call the *Bias-Optimization trade-off*.
I may or may not come to some conclusion which is relevant for self-play RL and ML in general.

* Generalization: being applicable in real self-defense situation.
* Constrained optimization: rules

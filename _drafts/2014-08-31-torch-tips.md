# Getting started with torch
Torch is an open source machine learning package, focused on deep learning.
It provides a modular structure to build deep neural networks.
Getting started with torch can be a little daunting.
Since I recently went through the process of learning torch and lua, I want to share my experience and share some hints that might be useful if you start out.

Clement has written a full tutorial which you can find here.
I recommend following that tutorial, but be aware that it is really written as a complete functioning piece of code you have to analyze by yourself.
This tutorial is more basic, and aims to get you insight in the modules by playing around on the command line.

# Get your hands dirty

If you are familiar with python, these are roughly the mappings of packages. Notice that torch is overloaded as the name of the whole project, and the package providing the basic Tensor datastructure.
+ torch (Tensors) -> numpy.
+ nn -> neural network package containing the modules.

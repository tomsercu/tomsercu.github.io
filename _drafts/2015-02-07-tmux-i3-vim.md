My only superpower is seamlessly navigating between vim splits and tmux panes with the same shortcuts `ctrl+hjkl`.
Here's how it's set up.

To complete my tiled layout of everything, I started using tmux with panes.
With tmux you can tile panes in a similar way like tiling in i3 and vim splits.
Now the challenge becomes: how to easily navigate across windows from i3, tmux, and vim.

To start off, Chtid Toomey has the nice tmux vim plugin on https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator

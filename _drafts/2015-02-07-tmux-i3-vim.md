My only superpower is seamlessly navigating between vim splits and tmux panes with the same shortcuts `ctrl+hjkl`.
Here's how it's set up.

I like to work terminal-based as much as possible.
The essential tools I use are mosh, tmux and vim.

vim panes; navigation shortcuts

hitting boundaries

[vim tmux navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator)

Kinda irrelevant: <https://blog.filippo.io/my-remote-shell-session-setup/>

Mouse mode, allows mouse scrolling in tmux pane buffer.
alternate mode on for vim/less: pass the scrolling into vim.
Found this repo made it possible! <https://github.com/NHDaly/tmux-better-mouse-mode>

Note we need option+click for select - time will tell if it's worth it as a tradeoff for the benefit of scrolling.

My whole setup can be found in <https://github.com/tomsercu/dotfiles>

Still TODO
* Find a way to avoid the Option + Click

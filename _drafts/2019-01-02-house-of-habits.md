title:  "House of habits. My main lesson from 2018."

In 2018 I became a parent.
One of the best pieces of parenting advice I got was this:
"Don't fall in the trap of finding some solution that works in the moment,
then keep doing the same thing for too long.
You have to keep trying new things all the time."
This has become the biggest lesson I learned from becoming a parent in 2018.

Think about the first time you took the train/car/subway to work.
You were alert, focused at every stop, making sure you're on the right train and you get off at the right time.
Two months later this train ride became your commute, you're barely noticing
the stops as you sip your coffee and listen to your headphones.
That's how we lead our lives: pushing conscious actions into patterns and habits as soon as we can,
which allows us to save energy to leave it up to the autopilot.
<!-- TODO you choose habits based on what is OPTIMAL in that moment --> 

As soon as you create a habit, you look right through it.
It becomes an invisible, transparent part of your daily routine.
We stack habit upon habit, pattern upon pattern.
They interweave into the fabric of how we live our days, weeks, years.

There is no way to map out all your habits and patterns - many of them we were taught as a child,
and we never consciously realized.
Many others we just copied and quietly assimilated from our social environment.
<!--TODO more examples what i mean with INVISIBLE habits and patterns. stay within physical. -->

When you make a major life change, when you move abroad, or you start a new job,
your habits have to change. It is exhausting, intense and thrilling.
You spend the majority of your mental energy in navigating the new space, new social situations, 
and subconsciously mapping out the habits and patterns that will stick with you during your time there.
In these situations, there is no choice but to change, since there is a clear breaking point between old and new.

A much more subtle and difficult situation is when you have to adapt your habits to a slow, gradual drift
of the environment.
When there's no single breaking point, no one-day big change that forces you to actively think and decide
what is the optimal action in that moment.
You can just maintain your old habits, keep the patterns, but as the environment drifts they become less and less optimal.
This is exactly what's happening with a baby: day to day the changes are tiny, barely noticable.
Over the course of weeks and months, your baby has changed completely but you barely noticed it happening.

Many things you're doing, patterns you established, make no more sense but you never noticed.
If you started from here, you'd make completely different decisions, but you never restart,

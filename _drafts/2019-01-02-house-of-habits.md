title:  "House of habits. My main lesson from 2018."

In 2018 I became a parent.
One of the best pieces of parenting advice I got was this:
"Don't fall in the trap of finding some solution that works in the moment,
then keep doing the same thing for too long.
You have to keep trying new things all the time."
This has become the biggest lesson I learned from becoming a parent in 2018.

Think about the first time you took the train/car/subway to work.
You were alert, focused at every stop, making sure you're on the right train and you get off at the right time.
Two months later this train ride became your commute, you're barely noticing
the stops as you sip your coffee and listen to your headphones.
That's how we lead our lives: creating patterns and habits as soon as we can,
so we stop spending energy on them.

As soon as you create a habit, you look right through it. It becomes invisible, transparent.
You stack habit upon habit

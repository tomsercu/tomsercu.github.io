The dynamics of keeping your storage closet organized is an excellent metaphor of technical debt in a large software project.

* Technical debt is a metaphor but still kind of technical
* Much easier to explain to a non-technical person (cough manager cough)

Ok so here's the truth: your software project is like a storage closet.
Anytime you write code, you're storing something new in your storage closet.
You have to spend time to organize it and keep it clean.
But a clean storage closet is worth it in the long run,
as you save tons of time not having to search through a mess
anytime you need to find back those hiking shoes / old laptop / ...

Anytime you put something in the storage closet you tell yourself you'll just remember where exactly
you put this lockbox but two days later you already forgot.
Forget about keeping the whole thing in memory, the only thing you can do is to structure and organize it in a way
that makes sense, to make sure you can easily get to that chess set without you needing to move 10 boxes out of the way first.

<!--refactoring reorganizing storage closet. to varying intensity-->
But invariably, as you gradually add stuff to your closet, at some point you need to refactor:
just pull everything out, reshuffle boxes and shelves, and find a new ordering that makes more sense.


Every storage closet has its dirty secrets

rush out the door leave a mess

but mess attracts mess

OOP: organized in boxes that make sense together. even if the boxes are messily organized, they can stay clean in themselves.

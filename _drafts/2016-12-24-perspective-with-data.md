As 2016 draws to a close and many feel that 2016 has been a shit-ass year, I want to share my eternal optimist perspective.

+ Problem is with news reporting that single events are captured, while positive change typically comes from hard work by many people through long periods of time. That just doesn't make the news.
+ None of us (in the West) have lived through a war. Our grandparents have, and among their parents' generation almost every one did too. It makes us loose perspective of what 
+ My favorite pet peeve is that this is just a human condition: feeling like it used to be better. Greek mythology has this concept of "Golden Age", which by definition is not now. ``Now'' in any novel is the Iron Age, after Bronze, Silver & Golden age the world is in decline.

Again a post mostly for my own memory: how I set up my website
with jekyll, github pages, a custom domain, and disqus.

# Jekyll and Github pages basic setup
Mostly done in the past, so this is from memory:

* jekyll is a static website rendering engine which takes input files (typically markdown),
    and outputs a pretty html static website in its `_site/` subdir.
* github pages (gh-pages) plays together really well with jekyll; as in you initialize a repository,
    initialize it with jekyll, check in the jekyll *input* files, and gh-pages will auto-render
    and serve.
* The main homepage and index over the blog posts are "Front Matter" pages, written in markdown.
* I use the kramdown dialect which seems pretty flexible & powerful.
* I probably chose one of the simplest default themes, very plain and basic. Fits my personality.

# Setting up DNS in GoDaddy
I registered my domain with GoDaddy (the biggest domain name registrar, as I read somewhere).
Now I need to set it up so the domain name cleanly points to the github pages.
Followed mostly [this tutorial](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-set-up-godaddy-domain-with-github-pages-a9300366c7b)
to set up the DNS to point to my github pages.

My specific setting: I want the whole website to be under a subdomain (`tom.sercu.me`),
and redirect either `sercu.me` or `www.sercu.me` there.
I set this up through [Subdomain Forwarding](https://www.godaddy.com/help/manually-forward-or-mask-your-domain-or-subdomain-422) 
in the GoDaddy dashboard.
For the apex domain `sercu.me` to redirect to the `tom` subdomain, I just added a Subdomain Forwarding,
filled in `@` for subdomain (I kinda guessed that this means empty string in DNS speak, which it is).
This actually became (non sub-) Domain Forwarding and overwrote the 4 github pages IP's by a GoDaddy IP.

[Turns out](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/)
that the IP settings as A records seem to only matter for setting up the apex (root) domain,
so just setting the CNAME in my DNS settings: `tom` -> `tomsercu.github.io` is enough.
Confirmed with `dig tom.sercu.me` does list the 4 github IP's.

## Investigating load times
This seems pretty good `https://tools.pingdom.com/#!/cH6lCN/tom.sercu.me`
* DNS 34ms, wait 13ms
* some http to https redirect going on (got flagged): 
    ```
Remove the following redirect chain if possible:
http://tom.sercu.me/
https://tom.sercu.me/
    ```
    But I'm not easily finding how to remove that redirect chain.. isn't it up to the browser to
    query https immediately rather than first trying http?
* Longer lifetime of browser caching for `https://tom.sercu.me/css/main.css`
    maybe a jekyll setting?

# Fancier Jekyll stuff
<script type="text/javascript" async

</script>

* `header.html`  has a responsive site-nav thingy on the right side, which iterates over Jekyll `site.pages`, which
    is alphabetic by default. Instead I added a liquid filter to sort according to an order, set in the YAML front matter. 

{% raw %}
      {% assign sorted_pages = site.pages | sort:"order" %}
      {% for page in sorted_pages %}
      etc
      {% endfor %}
{% endraw %}

* For references I use kramdown footnotes, simple enough.

* For math, $$\LaTeX$$ is supported by default through the `MathJax` javascript library.
    The library itself needs to be manually included on the page from CDN, see <http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/start.html>:

      <script type="text/javascript" async
        src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
      </script>
* Setting defaults in `_config.yml`; layout `page` or `post` for regular pages and posts respectively,
    and setting default author for posts.
* Using `page.categories` to organize posts between `blog`, `paper` (summaries), `talks`, `media`.
    Each of those 4 categories has its own index page, which is abstracted into a layout.
    A shortlist (most recent / selected) appears on the main page through liquid array filtering 
    (`slice` to truncate, `where` to filter selected publications).
    The formatting of entries is different depending on category, but should be consistent 
    between full index pages and truncated frontpage; this is abstracted into `_includes/indexlist.html`
    where the category and list is passed in as arguments.

## Still TODO
* DONE Right Floating pic on homepage
* DONE Copying or linking to the old NYU cims lab website for DS-GA-1007.
* NOPE Use structured data files for selected publications and talks, iterate.
* Organize posts with `category`: `blog`, `papers` for paper summaries, `category: talks` or `media` using yaml front matter
* Change colors like cims website
* email fwd
* pdf previews like karpathy, this seems right <https://github.com/karpathy/arxiv-sanity-preserver/blob/master/thumb_pdf.py>
* Add disqus
* Use/display the tags somewhere.
